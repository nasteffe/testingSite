title: Hart on Subversive Experience

On David Armstrong's new YouTube channel, A Perennial Digression, he's done a beautiful job interviewing two of the Hart brothers. As the channel's title would suggest, Armstrong warmly welcomes each digression and readily finds each quickly giving way to the varied topics that energize and inspire each of them. Having only completed half of his interview with Addison, entitled "Silent Pilgrimage", I hoped to jot down a few of my reflections thus far.

Hart offers some thoughts on the subversive character of direct/spiritual experience to the reigning power structures. If we are being extraordinarily charitable to the church and its leadership, direct experience of God would allow the individual Christian to remain alone in their discernment and vulnerable to maleficient spiritual beliefs (i.e. heresy) or forces. Hart recognizes as much when he encourages potential meditators to seek out wise guides to walk beside them through the process, providing preparation for and discernment of the experience itself. On the other hand, if we are being more critical of the the role of church authority, direct mystical experience outside of the sacramental spaces as defined by church authorities potentially represent a space for criticizing and even subverting authority. The church's stance has spanned this range, from a pastoral concern for individual's souls to near authoritarian attempts to stamp them out. 

The personal experience of God, whether speaking of the Quietist movements in the 17th century, Hesychasts in the 14th, or Chan, as Hart discusses in the interview, direct experience of reality is seen as destabilizing and disturbing to the powers that be, which themselves wish to inscribe and ground their authority in that reality. To this end, the church lays out recommended devotional practices, like the rosary, which becomes "weaponized" insofar as it presents a licit, while carefully circumscribed, practice, preferred by the church itself. Hart sees within the rosary's mysteries, room for the kind of contemplation so often lacking in modern devotional practice and wrote [a book exploring these mysteries](https://wipfandstock.com/9781725272323/silent-rosary/) using the iconography of Solrunn Nes.

Hart's emphasis on direct experience is what he sees in these meditative traditions (including the Evagrian tradition in the church fathers as well as Chan with its Taoist roots) are practices of presence that brings us to see ourselves and to make room for encountering God. He sees the teachings of Jesus as an outworking of this loving presence into the world, a pragmatic encounter that refuses to be theorized, to be contained within speculative thought.

What seems particularly interesting to me about this approach is that it brings these disparate groups together across traditions, even at times across religions, rooted in the belief that fostering a thicker sense of presence can bring us closer to seeing ourselves more clearly, to honestly encountering others and their needs, and to God. Similarly, it resists speculative reason. 

into a larger conversation about our ability to encounter ourselves, the world around us, and God.

## To Do
"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him." (Linji Yixuan in the 9th century)

This traditional Chan saying seems to be a reminder that locating enlightenment within the other is idolatry. It sets up in our minds an undivided image of the other that has stopped us from encountering them honestly, directly. Honesty reminds us that we must look to the cracks to see the subject beneath.

Killing the Buddha is iconoclasm.

Personally, I confess that I find it easy to look to others whom I can follow. I look for the adults in the room, for those who can provide the structure for life. Once I'm _with_ someone else, I feel comfortable deepening and improvising on their story, but up until that point, I often feel stuck in Kierkegaard's anxiety of freedom. As a child, I would sit with the adults easily, but felt overwhelmed by children, dizzied by knowing what I was supposed to do or say next.
