St. Bernard
“humility is the virtue by which a man abases himself by reason of his perfect self-knowledge”
> Humilitas est virtus qua homo verissima sui cognitione sibi ipsi vilescit (De gradibus humilitatis, cap. 1).


The author draws attention to the two primary causes of humility, our fallenness and God's love. While the former is imperfect because both our natural state and our awareness thereof is impermanent, the latter remains perfect.
> In itself, humility is nothing else but a man’s true understanding and awareness of himself as he really is. It is certain that if a man could truly see and be conscious of himself as he really is, he would indeed be truly humble. There are two causes of this meekness: One is the foulness, wretchedness and weakness into which a man has fallen by sin. As long as he lives in this life, no matter how holy he is, he must always experience this in some measure. The other is the superabundant love and worthiness of God himself. At the sight of this, all nature trembles, all learned men are fools, and all the saints and angels are blinded; so much so that were it not for the wisdom of his godhead, whereby due proportion is set between their contemplation and their natural and grace-given capacity, I would be at a loss to say what would happen to them. _Cloud of Unknowing_ (147)

While the recognition of our own sin is known through our intellect (left brain), our knowledge of being loved by God is known in felt experience (right brain). The author notes that the soul "may suddenly lose and forget all awareness and experience of its own being", the imperfect falls away and the perfect remains. Like little children [^1], we must forget our selves, deny ourselves.

{{ On this account, carrying our own cross means reconciling ourselves to the sheer brokenness, the cracks in the world. }}


The author shares two practices to manage one's sinful thoughts and impulses: the first being to look behind the mental activity, the second to humble yourself before it, allowing it to wash over you. He relates the latter to humility.
> And truly it seems to me that if this device is properly understood in its subtlety, it is nothing else but a true knowledge and experience of yourself as you are, a wretch, filth, far worse than nothing. This knowing and experience is humility. _Cloud of Unknowing_ (181)

This reminds me of a DBT counseling practice for handling distressing emotions. 

Linehan suggests a practice of experiencing the emotion as an ocean wave, coming in and out, waves that can be surfed rather than blocked or restrained. The waves crash. Like any wave, they will recede, unless we cling to them, rehearse them, or amplify them.[^2]
